Requirements
-------------

* Git
* ZSH
* RVM
* Vim

In fact, there's the only thing is _really_ needed is git, but there is no sense to use
this dotfile without other stuff

Installation
------------

Clone repo

``` bash-session
$ git clone https://github.com/SqREL/dotfiles
```

Re-enter to your terminal emulator and do

``` bash-session
$ dotfiles_update
```
